# Metagenomic bin processor
This is a collection of tools used for downstream analysis of data from both contig and gene-based metagenomic binners. <br>
For complete reproducibility, the repository will eventually also contain complete workflows for both contig and gene-based binning.
The [webpage](https://gisledk.github.io/Vamb_tools/) contains the documentation and overview of current workflows found in this repository.
